# Editing Style Analysis: AI vs Manual Cuts

## Summary of Findings

Based on comparing the AI-generated cuts with your manual edits of the iOS 26 settings video, here are the key insights:

### 📊 Overall Statistics

| Metric | AI-Generated | Your Manual Edit | Difference |
|--------|-------------|------------------|------------|
| **Total Duration** | 59.3 min | 17.6 min | -41.7 min (-70%) |
| **Number of Clips** | 81 | 150 | +69 clips |
| **Average Clip Length** | 43.9s | 7.1s | -36.8s |
| **Retention Rate** | - | 29.7% of AI content | Much more aggressive |

### 🎬 Key Differences in Editing Philosophy

1. **You Cut MUCH More Aggressively**
   - The AI kept 59.3 minutes of content
   - You kept only 17.6 minutes (70% reduction!)
   - This suggests the AI is way too conservative, even with Claude's editing

2. **You Prefer Shorter, Tighter Clips**
   - Your average clip: 7.1 seconds
   - AI average clip: 43.9 seconds
   - You make 6x more cuts to keep the pace moving

3. **Your Clip Distribution**
   ```
   Your Manual Edit:
   - <2s:    20 clips (13%)  ← Quick cuts for emphasis
   - 2-5s:   56 clips (37%)  ← Your sweet spot
   - 5-10s:  42 clips (28%)  ← Standard segments
   - 10-20s: 25 clips (17%)  ← Important explanations
   - >20s:    7 clips (5%)   ← Rare, only for crucial content

   AI Generated:
   - <2s:     5 clips (6%)
   - 2-5s:   13 clips (16%)
   - 5-10s:  20 clips (25%)
   - 10-20s: 20 clips (25%)
   - >20s:   23 clips (28%)  ← AI keeps too many long segments
   ```

### 💡 What This Means for Improving the System

#### 1. **Much More Aggressive Cutting Needed**
The current prompt is still too conservative. We need to:
- Remove more repetition
- Cut out more thinking pauses
- Be stricter about what constitutes "essential" content
- Aim for 25-35% retention instead of 70%

#### 2. **Segment Length Targets**
Your editing style suggests optimal targets:
- **Majority** of clips should be 2-10 seconds
- **Avoid** clips longer than 20 seconds unless absolutely necessary
- **Include** very short clips (<2s) for emphasis or quick points

#### 3. **Pacing Preferences**
- You prefer a fast-paced, dynamic edit
- Quick cuts keep viewer engagement
- Longer explanations are broken into smaller digestible chunks

### 🔧 Recommended Prompt Adjustments

Based on this analysis, the Claude prompt should be updated to:

```
You are editing a YouTube tutorial video. Be AGGRESSIVE in removing content.

CUTTING RULES:
1. Remove ANY repetition, even if slightly different wording
2. Remove ALL thinking pauses, "um", "uh", "you know"
3. Remove false starts and incomplete thoughts
4. Remove redundant explanations - keep only the clearest one
5. If someone says the same thing twice, keep only the best take
6. Aim to keep only 25-35% of the original content

WHAT TO KEEP:
- Essential instructions and steps
- Key information that moves the tutorial forward
- The clearest, most concise explanation of each point
- Brief, punchy statements

REMEMBER:
- Viewers can pause and rewatch if needed
- Fast pacing keeps engagement
- When in doubt, CUT IT OUT
```

### 📈 Metrics to Track

To match your editing style, the system should aim for:
- **Target retention**: 25-35% of original content
- **Average clip length**: 5-10 seconds
- **Clip distribution**: 70% under 10 seconds
- **Maximum clip length**: 30 seconds (rare exceptions)

### 🎯 Action Items for System Improvement

1. **Update Claude prompt** to be much more aggressive
2. **Add clip-splitting logic** to break long segments into shorter ones
3. **Implement pacing analysis** to ensure dynamic rhythm
4. **Add configurable aggressiveness levels**:
   - Light: Current settings (70% retention)
   - **Standard: Your style (30% retention)**
   - Aggressive: Ultra-tight (15% retention)
5. **Better detection of repetition** across the entire transcript

## Conclusion

Your editing style is **significantly more aggressive** than what the AI currently produces. You create a fast-paced, engaging video by cutting 70% of the content and using much shorter clips. The system needs major adjustments to match your professional editing standards.
